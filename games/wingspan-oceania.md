Wingspan: Oceania Expansion focuses on birds in Australia and New Zealand. It's designed by Elizabeth Hargrave and features birds illustrated by Natalia Rojas and Ana Maria Martinez.

In this second expansion to Wingspan colorful and awe-inspiring birds from Oceania are added. The Oceania bird cards are designed to be shuffled into the bird cards from the base game, with or without other expansions.

This expansion includes new player mats and a new food type, allowing players to explore different strategies in this new environment. It also includes new bonus cards and more end-of-round goals, as well as a new color of egg.
