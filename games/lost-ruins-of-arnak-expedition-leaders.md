Return to the mysterious island of Arnak in Lost Ruins of Arnak: Expedition Leaders!

Give your expedition an edge by choosing one of six unique leaders, each equipped with different abilities, skills, and starting decks that offer different strategies and styles of play for you to explore.

In addition to the leader abilities, which bring a new element of asymmetry to the game, this expansion contains alternative research tracks that offer even more variety and a bigger challenge, new item and artifact cards to create new combos and synergies, along with more guardians & assistants to meet and sites to explore.
