The Ice Age Pack adds even more variety to your park with additional components and gameplay. Place these mammal enclosures anywhere in your park (yes, anywhere - even next to dinosaurs) and roll a special Ice die when activating them. You will also score adjacency bonuses for these enclosures at the end of the game. However, you can only claim one bonus per creature you've built - so make sure to plan wisely!
