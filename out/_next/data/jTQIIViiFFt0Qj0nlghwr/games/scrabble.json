{"pageProps":{"gameData":{"id":"scrabble","contentHtml":"<p>In this classic word game, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.</p>\n","title":"Scrabble","expansion":false,"lead":"Carefully place your lettered tiles to make high-scoring words.","linkBgg":"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/404651/scrabble","linkOfficial":"https://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us"}},"__N_SSG":true}
