Contraptions can be assembled as a Workshop Action, for the cost of 1 Coin per Contraption already in place. They can be used any time during a player's turn by turning them to their inactive side, and receiving a bonus based on the player's Magic school - in the above example, the Mechanical Contraption, the Generator, supplies the city with electricity, netting its owner a steady income of Coins.</p>
<p>Each Contraption has a more powerful effect than the one below it. At the end of a round, each Contraption with enough Shards next to it can be reactivated and used again next turn - this follows the similar principle as the Magician Powers module (which is playable with Contraptions). The highest-level Contraptions are so breathtaking that simply reactivating them will earn you some Fame!</p>
<p>The Contraptions module includes 16 Contraptions with 4 unique illustrations, printed on 3mm blackcore cardboard, and 4 board extensions.</p>
<p>When you learn a Trick from your own school, you may choose to learn your Signature Trick instead (if you meet its Fame threshold). Each Signature Trick “upgrades” a Trick from the original set: for example, Professor Bernard can learn his Legendary Shark Tank signature trick instead of the “ordinary” Water Tank Escape. If a Signature Trick is learned, the standard version is removed from the deck. And if an opponent already learned its standard version, your Signature Trick no longer has a Fame Threshold!</p>
