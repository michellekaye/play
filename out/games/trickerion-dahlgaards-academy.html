<p>A new Location - the Academy: Join the common effort to renovate the Academy! Each Renovation action awards Fame proportionately to the Coins spent on it, and opens up new Classrooms and Practice Rooms, where Academy markers can be placed. Academy markers in Practice Rooms give the performed Tricks increased Yield or other special placement abilities, while the Tricks taught in the Classrooms will be passed on to the new generations - they can no longer be performed, but grant a useful passive yield each turn. The Academy is also a place to train your Protegé, a new member of your team.</p>
<p>A new Specialist - the Protegé: Each Magician will now start with the Protegé, a new type of specialist. The Protegé is more than just a worker - they will accompany your Magician on their path to greatness, constantly developing in the process. By Visiting the Academy, Protegés can acquire powerful new abilities that also increase their Action Points - and their salary as well! A fully developed Protegé will have 3 Actions points, just like the Magician, with some very powerful abilities to boot!</p>
<p>A new quartet of Magicians: Magoria’s new Golden Age attracts aspiring young Magicians from all over the world, eager to prove themselves, and maybe one day become the Patron of Magoria. Each school of illusion (Mechanical, Optical, Escape, Spiritual) will receive a new, charismatic Magician, with their own personal backstory, powerful special ability.</p>
<p>Solo Mode: Dalhgaard's Heir: This expansion will also feature a solo mode, with an elaborate story setting. Take a journey to a possible future of Magoria, where Dahlgaard’s Heir couldn’t resist the immense power of the Trickerion Stone, and dabbing into the supernatural has eclipsed their sanity. Magoria’s Golden Age is over - now the Heir controls it with an iron grip, and it falls to you to prove your superiority and remove him from power the only way the city knows - through magic and illusion. This solo mode features Dahlgaard’s Heir as a fully automated, intricate opponent with variable difficulty levels - a worthy foe to even the most seasoned Trickerion veterans!</p>
